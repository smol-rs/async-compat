Compatibility adapter between tokio and futures.

There are two kinds of compatibility issues between [tokio] and [futures]:

2. Tokio's types cannot be used outside tokio context, so any attempt to use
   them will panic.
    - Solution: If you apply the `Compat` adapter to a future, the future will enter the
      context of a global single-threaded tokio runtime started by this crate. That does
      *not* mean the future runs on the tokio runtime - it only means the future sets a
      thread-local variable pointing to the global tokio runtime so that tokio's types can be
      used inside it. Invoking `tokio::spawn` within a Compat future, would however, spawn 
      that task inside the global background thread.
      
2. Tokio and futures have similar but different I/O traits `AsyncRead`, `AsyncWrite`,
  `AsyncBufRead`, and `AsyncSeek`.
    - Solution: When the `Compat` adapter is applied to an I/O type, it will implement traits
      of the opposite kind. That's how you can use tokio-based types wherever futures-based
      types are expected, and the other way around.

## Examples

This program reads lines from stdin and echoes them into stdout, except it's not going to work:

```rust
fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    futures::executor::block_on(async {
        let stdin = tokio::io::stdin();
        let mut stdout = tokio::io::stdout();

        // The following line will not work for two reasons:
        // 1. Runtime error because stdin and stdout are used outside tokio context.
        // 2. Compilation error due to mismatched `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits.
        futures::io::copy(stdin, &mut stdout).await?;
        Ok(())
    })
}
```

To get around the compatibility issues, apply the `Compat` adapter to `stdin`, `stdout`, and
[`futures::io::copy()`]:

```rust
use async_compat::CompatExt;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    futures::executor::block_on(async {
        let stdin = tokio::io::stdin();
        let mut stdout = tokio::io::stdout();

        futures::io::copy(stdin.compat(), &mut stdout.compat_mut()).compat().await?;
        Ok(())
    })
}
```

It is also possible to apply `Compat` to the outer future passed to
[`futures::executor::block_on()`] rather than [`futures::io::copy()`] itself.
When applied to the outer future, individual inner futures don't need the adapter because
they're all now inside tokio context:

```rust
use async_compat::{Compat, CompatExt};

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    futures::executor::block_on(Compat::new(async {
        let stdin = tokio::io::stdin();
        let mut stdout = tokio::io::stdout();

        futures::io::copy(stdin.compat(), &mut stdout.compat_mut()).await?;
        Ok(())
    }))
}
```

The compatibility adapter converts between tokio-based and futures-based I/O types in any
direction. Here's how we can write the same program by using futures-based I/O types inside
tokio:

```rust
use async_compat::CompatExt;
use blocking::Unblock;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut stdin = Unblock::new(std::io::stdin());
    let mut stdout = Unblock::new(std::io::stdout());

    tokio::io::copy(&mut stdin.compat_mut(), &mut stdout.compat_mut()).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Finally, we can use any tokio-based crate from any other async runtime.
Here are [reqwest] and [warp] as an example:

```rust
use async_compat::{Compat, CompatExt};
use warp::Filter;

fn main() {
    futures::executor::block_on(Compat::new(async {
        // Make an HTTP GET request.
        let response = reqwest::get("https://www.rust-lang.org").await.unwrap();
        println!("{}", response.text().await.unwrap());

        // Start an HTTP server.
        let routes = warp::any().map(|| "Hello from warp!");
        warp::serve(routes).run(([127, 0, 0, 1], 8080)).await;
    }))
}
```
